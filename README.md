# 📄 Agentic-AI-Document-Compliance

## 📌 Project Overview

Agentic AI Document Compliance is a modular prototype designed to automate document compliance validation using an agent-based architecture. It processes documents such as invoices, bills of lading, IDs, paystubs, etc. by extracting relevant fields, validating them against predefined rules, detecting discrepancies across documents, and providing a user-friendly interface for review.

This project demonstrates how multiple specialized agents work together in an orchestrated workflow to streamline document processing and compliance checks.
